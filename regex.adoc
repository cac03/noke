= Regex

:toc:

This document contains some of my notes about regular expressions, mostly used within Java

== Greedy vs Reluctant quantifiers

=== Greedy

Greedy quantifier makes regex engine consume all matching characters __eagerly__.

Consider the following test:

[source,java]
----
@Test
void greedyQuantifierConsumesAllCharacters() {
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("a.*(b*)");
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("abbb");

    assertTrue(matcher.find());
    assertEquals("", matcher.group(1));
}
----

The sequence matched by the first group is empty because all characters after the `a` were consumed by the `.*` so there is nothing left for `b*`.

=== Reluctant

On the other hand the reluctant quantifier consumes all characters __lazily__.

[source,java]
----
@Test
void reluctantModifierConsumesCharactersLazily() {
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("a.*?(b*)");
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("abbb");

    assertTrue(matcher.find());
    assertEquals("bbb", matcher.group(1));
}
----

In this case the `.*?` is reluctant, this means that it won't consume any characters unless it has to.
